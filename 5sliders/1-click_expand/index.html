<!-- 
    Flex = 0.5 means, you have flex-grow = 0.5, flex-shrink = 1 and flex-basis = 0 you are allocating
     the available space to flex items.

Let's just say, you have a container (Assuming div element) of width: 100vw with two 
flexible items(div elements) of each 40vw in it. So the total width consumed 
by your two div elements will be equals to 80vw and the left over available 
space would be 20vw. Now, You have set the flex = 0.5 for each of the two div 
elements. so, Each div element will grow up by 20vw/2 = 10vw in order to fully occupy 
the free space of the container.

<!-- 
    But! If we were to change the default of the flex-grow property from 0 to 1, 
    like thisâ€¦ Then all the elements will take an equal portion of the 
    .parent element, but only if the lengths of their contents are the same.

     in the example above, the first two child elements will take up 
     proportionally the same amount of space but that third element will try 
     to grow up to three times the space as the others.

      If we instead add flex: 2 to just one of the divs, then that div would 
      grow to 2x the size of the others.
